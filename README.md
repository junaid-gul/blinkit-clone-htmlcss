# Blinkit Clone

A front-end practice project — cloning the Blinkit homepage using **HTML** and **CSS** only.

Built to improve layout, responsiveness, and styling skills. No JavaScript, no frameworks — just raw frontend vibes.

## 📌 What I Practiced

- HTML structure & clean code
- CSS styling with custom classes
- Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design using media queries
- How real websites organize their sections

## 💻 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 📱 Responsive?

Yes. Layout adjusts for:
- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` — main structure
- `style.css` — default styles
- `media.css` — responsive styles
- `images/` — all assets and banners used

## 🚧 Note

This is a **learning project**, not for commercial use.  
Images and design are inspired by Blinkit for practice purposes only.
